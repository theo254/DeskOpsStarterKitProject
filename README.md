# DeskOpsStarterKitProject
The purpose of this project was to work as a communication log, equipment log, and the beginnings of a lockout key log for the residence hall I was working with at the time. This project utilized Agile methodology and was started in 2017. Project was last released in a working state on a previous sprint, but was never finalized.
